# Punk Rock Table Challenge  
**Semantic HTML & CSS – Completed Solution**

This repository contains a completed solution to the **Semantic HTML/CSS Table Challenge**, focused on producing a fully responsive, accessible data table styled to a punk-inspired visual brief.

The project demonstrates correct semantic markup, disciplined CSS layering, and controlled layout techniques to meet a detailed design specification.

---

## Project Overview

The objective of this challenge was to build a **semantic HTML table** and apply **advanced CSS styling** while maintaining accessibility, responsiveness, and clean structure.

Key goals included:
- Correct semantic table structure
- Full-width responsive layout
- Layered visual effects using gradients and textures
- Strict adherence to provided colour, font, and layout rules

---

## Key Features & Techniques

### Semantic HTML
- Proper use of `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`
- Logical separation of header, body, and summary data
- Improved accessibility and CSS targeting

### Layout Control
- `table-layout: fixed` used for predictable column sizing
- Column widths controlled via `<th>` elements
- Table scales to fill its container using percentage-based widths

### Borders & Structure
- `border-collapse: collapse` for clean, single-line borders
- Consistent purple border styling across table, headers, and cells

### Layered CSS Styling
- Gradient overlays applied to `<thead>` and `<tfoot>`
- Leopard skin image layered beneath header and footer gradients
- Noise texture applied **only** to `<tbody>`

### Zebra Striping
Improved readability through alternating row colours:
- Odd rows: `#ff33cc` (Hot Pink)
- Even rows: `#e495e4` (Light Pink / Mauve)

### Typography
Two fonts are used to establish contrast:
- **Rock Salt** – headers, footer, decorative text
- **Helvetica Neue** – body text and data cells
